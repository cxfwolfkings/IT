## 纸镇

    The town was paper, but the memories were not

    今天小编给大家推荐的书是《纸镇》，作者是美国作家约翰·格林。
    
    格林在2005年出版了第一部小说《寻找阿拉斯加》，获得了普利策文学奖；2012年出版的《无比美妙的痛苦》被视为他最高水平的杰作，曾长时间占据《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜首位。
    
    这部《纸镇》因其悬疑元素获得了爱伦·坡奖，并在2015年被改编成了同名电影。
    
    小说的主人公昆汀是个普通的高中男生，一直暗恋自己的青梅竹马玛戈。玛戈与平平无奇的昆汀不同，她十分出众，是学校里的风云人物。
    
    某天夜晚，玛戈敲开了昆汀的窗户，带着他踏上了大冒险的旅程。他们一起报复了玛戈那个劈腿的男友，爬上高楼，闯进海洋公园……经历了惊心动魄的一晚。可是在这之后，玛戈却失踪了。
    
    玛戈一向潇洒，以前就曾离家出走，所以家人和警察都没有把她的失踪放在心上，并不急着寻找她。但昆汀却不愿放弃，根据玛戈留下的线索，一步步靠近、了解自己爱慕多年的女孩。
    
    最后的线索指向了一千多里外一个不应该存在的地方，也就是纸镇。昆汀和几个朋友一起开了二十多个小时的车，在纸镇见到了玛戈。玛戈会和昆汀一起回来吗？翻开书去寻找答案吧。
    
    这是一本内容丰富的青少年小说。既有奇妙精彩的探险情节，也有细腻动人的情感描写。自由洒脱的玛戈，原先胆小害羞却不断突破自己、重新认识自己的昆汀，放弃毕业典礼、陪着昆汀一起去找玛戈的热血小伙伴，每一个角色都有自己的魅力。
    
    下面是这本书的节选，附上小编的翻译，欢迎在评论区留言讨论~
    
    “That's always seemed so ridiculous to me, that people want to be around someone because they're pretty. It's like picking your breakfast cereals based on color instead of taste.”
    因为某个人长得好看，人们就想围在他身边，我总觉得很荒谬。就像吃早餐的时候挑麦片，不是根据味道来选，而是看颜色。
    
    “It is so hard to leave—until you leave. And then it is the easiest goddamned thing in the world.”
    离开很难，但真正离开的时候你就不觉得难了。到那时，离开简直是世界上最简单的事情。
    
    “The town was paper, but the memories were not.”
    小镇是纸做的，但回忆不是。
    
    “If you don't imagine, nothing ever happens at all.”
    如果你不去想象，那就什么都不会发生。
    
    “Talking to a drunk person was like talking to an extremely happy, severely brain-damaged three-year-old.”
    跟一个喝醉的人说话就像跟一个特别快乐、大脑受到严重损伤的三岁小孩说话。
    
    “As long as we don't die, this is gonna be one hell of a story.”
    只要我们不死，这就是一个精彩至极的故事。
    
    “Maybe all the strings inside him broke.”
    也许是他身体里所有的弦都断了。
    
    “At some point, you gotta stop looking up at the sky, or one of these days you'll look back down and see that you floated away, too.”
    你不能一直都抬头看天，不然总有一天你低头的时候会发现自己已经漂远了。
    
    “The rules of capitalization are so unfair to words in the middle of a sentence.”
    句子开头的单词首字母大写，这个规则对句子中间的单词来说太不公平了。
    
    “Nothing ever happens like you imagine it will.”
    没有什么事情会按照你想象中那样发生。

## 父亲留给我的最后的话

    [原文](http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1268499/)
    
    My Dad died in November.
    我的父亲11月份去世了。

    He was an ER doc, a Stephen Minister, a street art/graffiti artist, a college professor, a cancer researcher, a bee keeper, and a cookbook author.
    父亲身兼数职，他曾做过急诊科医生，咨询顾问，街头艺术家，大学教授，癌症研究专家，还当过养蜂人，写过美食烹饪类的书。

    He was a former US Marine, a book club leader, a community organizer,  
    and even though he could afford a new car, drove an old 1992 5-speed Honda with 200k+ miles on it, just because he liked it.
    他曾在美国海军服役，担任过读书俱乐部的领头人，主持过社区工作。他总是开着一辆1992年生产的本田汽车，有5个档位，累积路程超过20万公里，其实他完全支付得起一辆新车，却执意要开这辆，就因为他喜欢这车。

    He was the father of five, including two sets of twins, and all of them were born while he was in med school/doing his residency.
    他膝下有5个儿女，其中包括2对双胞胎，这些孩子都是他在医学院念书或者实习的时候出生的。

    He loved chaos and craziness , thrived on it.
    他喜欢家里吵吵闹闹的，喜欢疯狂的闹剧，这会让他神采焕发。

    Dad was diagnosed with Stage 4 esophageal cancer in 2008 and given two years to live,
    2008年，父亲被诊断患有重度食道癌，被宣判最多还有两年时间。

    just one day before our home was ruined by Hurricane Ike - and he lived for 10 years beyond his diagnosis .
    就在随后的一天，飓风艾克摧毁了我们的家。尽管如此，他还是比医生断言的寿命多活了10年。

    He loved working with the other cancer patients, and made an entire library in his office of humorous reading materials and DVD's
    他喜欢和其他的癌症病人互动，在自己的办公室里屯了满满一屋子的幽默读物和DVD，简直成了一家私人图书馆。
  
    and was always on the lookout for Butter Rum flavored Life Savers candies because he thought they were soothing to the throat.
    旁人一不留神，他就趁机把一颗黄油朗姆酒口味的Life Savers牌糖果塞入口中，他说这种糖的口感太柔滑了，简直入口即化。

    Spent a week living in the hospital during Hurricane Harvey so the staff whose homes had flooded did not have to come in.
    哈维飓风席卷美国的时候，为了给那些受水灾之苦的医院员工提供便利，他在医院里住了一个星期。

    Gave up his food so patients could be fed when high water cut off their food supply.
    医院里病患的口粮供应锐减时，他主动让出自己的口粮，好让病人们吃饱。

    Said it was the most interesting thing he had ever been a part of.
    还说，这是他参与过的最有意思的事情。

    To others, he was a doctor, a neighbor, or just a guy.
    对其他人来说，他是一个医生，一个邻居，或者仅仅是一个陌生男人。

    To me, he was a larger-than-life role model, easily the funniest person I ever met, and fiercely protective of those he loved.
    而对于我。他是我的传奇英雄，榜样，是我见过的最幽默的人，是那个拼命保护他所爱的家人的人。

    He couldn't stand the president of his neighborhood HOA - and anytime he saw a horror film or a Halloween witch portrayed on television, he would refer to it as "a documentary about our HOA president."
    他不能忍受社区物主协会的协会主席。每次他在电视上看到恐怖片里的魔鬼或者万圣节庆典上的女巫，他都会说，“这不就是我们的协会主席主演的纪录片吗？”

    A couple of days before he died, he told us it was time to go to Hospice Care, where he died three days later.
    在他去世前几天，他告诉我们，是时候送他去医院接受临终关怀了。三天后他就死在医院里。

    And he left me this message, telling me to share it with all the people I met:
    他给我留下了一条短信，告诉我，把这条短信跟所有我认识的人分享。

    "Please don't send flowers or be sad for me, I had a great life.
    请不要为我贡献花束，不要为我悲伤，我已经度过了幸福的一生。

    Instead, give yourself the gift of having joy in life.
    请享受生活中的欢乐，把这种生活态度作为礼物送给自己。

    Have a steak or a couple of great tacos and a beer.
    享用一块牛排，享用美味的玉米片，来杯啤酒。

    Fly a kite with your child or run with the family dog.
    和你的孩子一起去放风筝，和你家的狗一起去奔跑。

    Forgive someone (or yourself) for actions that happened in the past and move on with purpose.
    原谅别人（或者你自己），忘记他曾经做过的事情，让自己向前看。

    Connect with a childhood friend. Tell a teacher how much they meant to you
    与儿时的伙伴联系。告诉儿时的老师他们给了你多么重要的启迪。

    Live your life, love without fear of being hurt, and laugh every chance you get.
    真切的去生活，去爱，不要害怕受到伤害，珍惜每一个值得开心的机会去放声大笑。

    Look for the good. Donate your time with a cause you find important.
    看向事物好的一面。把时间用在你觉得重要的事情上。

    Or just look within to make things a little better inside your heart
    如果做不到，就探问一下自己的内心，让这件事在你的心里变得更有趣。

    Don't waste time, folks. The number one complaint I see in medicine is not disease, it's loneliness - don't fall into the trap of thinking you have time to spare.
    伙计们，不要虚度光阴。与医学打交道了一辈子，我发现人们抱怨最多的并不是疾病，而是孤独——别总想着自己没有时间，这是一个陷阱。

    Get out of the house. Put down the phone. Don't worry about "likes", replace all that with people you love.
    别闷在屋里。放下手机。别为“点赞”的事情着急，把这些精力投注到你爱的人身上去吧！

    Do more, and worry less.
    多行动，少忧劳。

    If you want to remember me well, do one kind thing today,
    如果你们想记住我，请就在今天做一件善良的事情。

    whether it's a smile for a stranger, having a bit of patience for someone struggling with their day, or helping a neighbor."
    任何善良的事情都可以，无论是给陌生人的一个微笑，对那些艰难维持生计的小贩多点耐心，还是给邻居提供帮助
  
    even if it's the head of your HOA and she's an old witch.
    ——即便这位邻居是你的社区物主协会主席，或者是一个老巫婆。

    I'll be watching. Remember, I love you, and always will - and there's not a thing you can do to change that
    我会在天上看着你们。记住，我爱你们，永远都爱。没有任何事情能改变这一点。

## 我花了20美元让世界变得更好

    I Paid For A Young Woman's Groceries
    我为一个女孩买了杂货

    I was in line at Trader Joe's and the young woman in front of me had her card declined, she embarrassedly>GetWord("embarrassedly"); > handed the cashier another card, which was also declined and then a final card that was approved for just $5.47.
    我在乔氏超市连锁店排着队，排在我前面女孩的银行卡因为余额不足被退回了，于是她不好意思地递给收银员另一张卡，但还是因为同样的理由被退回了，最后她又拿出了一张卡，但余额显示只有5.47美元。

    She asked the cashier to cancel the transaction. The cashier motions for manager. I smile and offer to pay the balance, which was $20 something dollars. 
    无奈之下，她只能让收银员取消交易。收银员示意了经理。我微笑了一下，然后帮女孩付了余款。

    The woman was very thankful, the cashier was happy.
    女孩很感激，收银员看到这一幕感到非常欣喜。

    On my way out the manager handed me a bouquet of mixed flowers. He didn't say anything, just held the flowers out to me.
    就在我走出超市时，经理递给了我一束花。但他什么也没说，只是把花递给了我。

    I saw he was overcomed with emotion. I suspected that if he opened his mouth he would start to cry. I accepted the flowers with thanks and walked out feeling that, for just a few moments, the world had become a better place.
    我看得出他是在克制情绪。我甚至怀疑他一旦张开嘴巴就会开始哭起来。我收下了花，并向他道谢。在我走出超市的那一刻，感觉世界都美好了起来。

## 所有的路，最终都是回家的路

    When I was a boy there were no smart phones, computers were something you saw on STAR TREK, and our television only got one channel clearly. Still, I was never bored. The fields, hills, and woodlands around my home were the perfect playground whose adventures were only limited by my imagination.
    当我还是个小男孩的时候，没有智能电话、电脑，也没有什么东西能够播放“星球大战”，电视只有一个频道是清楚的。即使这样，我也不觉得无聊。家附近的田野、山坡、林地都是极佳的玩耍场所，只有想不到，没有玩不到的冒险。

    I can remember once hiking to a nearby lake and slowly walking around it. At the backside of it I was amazed to find an old, one lane, dirt road that I had never seen before. I immediately set out to travel it. It was full of potholes and muddy tire tracks and deep woods bordered it on both sides, but exploring it still seemed like a fine adventure.
    我还记得有次徒步去附近的一个湖，我沿着湖边慢慢地走着，在湖的后部沿岸，我惊奇的发现之前没有的一条上了些年头的草坪泥泞路。我当即就决定去走走。这条路上遍布凹坑以及泥巴上的轮胎印，在路的两边类似分界线般的扎根的植物，这不失为一个冒险的好场所。

    I walked on and on for what seemed like hours. I am sure my guardian angel was whispering in my ear to turn around and head back home but I was stubborn and even a bit stupid, so I walked on.
    我走啊走，可能有好几个小时，守护我安全的小天使在我耳边低语，让我掉头回家，但我执拗，甚至显得有些愚蠢，依然执意往前走。

    The dirt road gave way to a gravel one and then a paved one, yet there was still neither a car nor a house in sight. My legs were getting tired. I noticed that the sun was starting to go down and I grew scared. I didn’t want to end up trapped on this road in the dark of night, but I was sure it would be dark before I could make my way back to the lake again.
    泥泞的路走着走着，渐渐变成了砂石路，又慢慢变成了平路，但是目力所及之处未见车和房子。我走得双腿疲累，太阳开始下山了，我开始害怕起来，我不想等天黑以后困在这条路上，但是如果现在往回，天黑前也回不到湖边。

    I continued to walk on with the fear growing inside of me. My heart was pounding and my legs were aching. I was almost in tears when I turned one last curve and saw something in the distance. It was a house that I recognized.
    我继续朝前走着，恐惧在我心理蔓延，心跳加速，双腿疼痛，泪水几乎要夺眶而出，我最后抬头一瞥，远处好像有什么东西，我认出那是一幢房子。

    My heart leapt up! I jumped up and down and laughed out loud. I knew the way home! It was still over a mile away but my legs felt like feathers and I hurried back to my house in no time. I walked in with a big smile on my face just in time for dinner. Then I ended my adventure with a good night’s sleep.
    我激动不已，上窜下跳，高兴地笑出了声，我认得这是回家的路。尽管还要一英里才能到家，我的腿却像羽毛般轻快，我迫不及待地回到家里，走进家中，喜悦之情溢于言表，而且正好赶上晚上的饭点。我的冒险以晚上的一场酣睡收尾。

    I remembered this recently when I saw a sign that said: “All roads lead Home.” This is true. In this life all roads no matter what their twists and turns can lead us home again. They can lead us to our homes here on Earth. They can lead us to our homes in our hearts.
    我记得最近见过的一则标语是这样说的：“所有的路都是回家的路。”确实是这样，这辈子所有的路不管怎样波折最终都会引导着我们回家，有的是回到地球上看得见摸得着的家，有的是回到心里的家。

    May you always walk your path with love. May you always help your fellow travelers along the way. And may your roads always lead you Home again.
    愿你的人生之路都有爱为伴，愿你在旅途中帮助同路人，愿你人生中的一段又一段旅程都是通往“家”的旅程。

## 当梦想照进目标：目标和梦想之间的10大差别

- Are you waiting for your dreams to come true and change your life? I am sorry to tell you that dreams don’t come true. Rather, it is your goals that can forever change your life. You need to set goals in order turn your dreams into reality.

  你正在等待你的梦想成真借以改变你的生活吗？我很遗憾地告诉你，梦想实现不了了。事实上，可以永远改变你的生活的是你的目标。为了把你的梦想变成现实，你需要设定目标。

- Don't confuse dreams and goals. Dreams are easy. They are free, too. However, dreams by themselves are just that… dreams. They are imaginary. And they don't produce tangible results. You need to turn your dreams into action. You need goals to make the visions of your dreams real.

  不要混淆梦想和目标。梦想来的容易，而且还是免费的。然而，梦想本身只是梦想，它们是虚构的。而且他们产生不了触手可及的结果。你需要把你的梦想变成行动，你需要目标使你的梦想变成现实。

- Dreams can inspire you, but goals can change your life. Goals are all about action. Goals change you and can change your life. What will it take to turn your dreams into goals?

  梦想可以激励你，但目标可以改变你的生活。目标都是关乎行动的，目标可以改变你，也可以改变你的生活。怎样才能把你的梦想变成目标？

- Here are 10 Big Differences Between Goals and Dreams:

  这里是目标和梦想之间的10大差异：

1. Goals are something you are acting on. Dreams are something you are just thinking about. Goals require action. Dreams can happen without lifting a finger, even while you are asleep.

   目标是指你可以采取的行动，梦想只是你的思考。目标则需要行动。梦想，不用动动手指头就能拥有，甚至在你睡着的时候。

2. Goals have deadlines. Dreams are just, well, dreams. Goals must have a deadline. They have a time limit. Dreams can go on forever. In fact, many people maintain dreams their entire lives without ever reaching them.

   目标有最后期限，梦想只是梦。目标必须有一个期限，它们有一个时间限制。梦想可以永远继续下去。事实上，许多人一生都在梦想，却从来没达到梦想。

3. Dreams are free. Goals have a cost. While you can daydream for free, goals don’t come without a price. Time, money, effort and sweat. How will you pay for your goals?

   梦想是免费的，目标是要付出代价的。虽然您可以免费做白日梦，但不付出努力，是无法实现目标的。时间、金钱、努力和汗水，你愿为你的目标付出什么？

4. Goals produce results. Dreams don't. Want to change your life? Your job? Your status in life? Goals can do that. A good friend of mine made six-figures on the ebook he published. He did that. Had it stayed as a dream, his life would have been as it always was.

   目标产生结果，梦想则不会。想要改变你的生活？你的工作？你的生活状态？目标可以实现这些。我的一个好朋友靠发表他的电子书赚了几十万。他做到了。如果只是作为一个梦想，他的生活依旧是老样子。

5. Dreams are imaginary. Goals are based in reality. You may dream of being Superman, but that is probably not going to happen. Goals are about what you can actually accomplish. They are grounded in the reality of our world. Goals should be big, but not supernatural.

   梦想是虚构的，目标是建立在现实中的。你可以梦想成为超人，但这不太可能发生，而目标则是关乎你可以完成的事，它们是以我们的现实世界为基础的。目标应该宏伟，但不会超越自然。

6. Goals have a finish line. Dreams never have to end. Dreams can go on forever. They don't have to have an ending point. Goals must have a specific outcome.

   目标有终点，梦想从来不会结束。梦想可以永远继续下去，它们不需要有终点。目标必须有一个特定的结果。

7. Dreams can inspire you. Goals can change your life. Dreams can bring you motivation. They can inspire you. But, goals can change your life forever.

   梦想可以激励你，目标可以改变你的生活。梦想可以带给你的动力，它们可以激励你。但是，目标能永远改变你的生活。

8. Goals must have focus. Dreams don't. Dreams can be drifting, ever-changingthoughts. Goals must be laser-focused. They must be specific and they must be always on your mind.

   目标必须有重点，梦想可以没有。梦想可以是漂浮的、千变万化的想法。目标必须是有聚焦的重点的，它们必须非常具体，同时必须时刻在你的脑子里。

9. Goals require hard work. Dreams just require your imagination. Dreaming is easy. Almost everyone has a dream. But, fewer people have goals. Goals are hard and they require hard work.

   目标需要努力工作，梦想只需要你的想象力。拥有梦想是容易的，几乎每个人都有一个梦想。但是很少有人设立目标。目标是艰难的，而且它们需要我们的努力工作才能实现。

10. Dreams stretch your imagination. Goals stretch you. Dreaming leads to bigger dreams. They stretch the limits of your imagination. But, goals stretch you. They increase your skills, your abilities, and change you forever.

   梦想拓展你的想象力，目标会拉伸你。梦想让你越做越大，它们延伸你的想象。但是，目标会拉伸你。它们提升你的技能、你的能力，而且改变你的一生。

- Sometimes it only takes one step to change a dream into a goal. Yet, it can take years to take that goal to the finish line. Always dream big, but make sure your goals are just as big. Because dreams don’t come true… but goals do.

  有时让梦想变成目标只需要一个步骤。然而，实现这一目标可能需要数年时间。梦想要大，你的目标一定也要大。因为梦想不能成真…...但目标可以。
